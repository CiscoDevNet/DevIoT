##Gateways
###[DevIoT Gateway Python SDK](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_Python_SDK)
This is DevIoT gateway service SDK and sample codes. You can use this SDK to register sensors to DevIoT, and sync up data and actions between the sensors and DevIoT.

###[DevIoT_RaspberryPi_Starter_Kit](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_RaspberryPi_Starter_Kit)
RaspberryPi gateway service can be used to work with DevIoT, supply the DevIot capability with read sensor data, control sensor status, define sensor action

This code also can be as a sample code to show how to use the Gateway Service SDK, use it build a completed gateway service which can work with DevIot

This guide will show how to build this sample step by step

###[DevIoT_Arduino_Starter_Kit](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_Arduino_Starter_Kit)
Arduino is common term for a software company, project, and user community, that designs and manufactures computer open-source hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices

Arduino gateway service can be used to work with DevIot, supply the DevIot capability with read sensor data, control sensor status, define sensor action

This code also can be as a sample code to show how to use the Gateway Service SDK, use it build a completed gateway service which can work with DevIoT
