##Gateways
###[DevIoT Gateway Python SDK](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_Python_SDK)
This is DevIoT gateway service SDK and sample codes. You can use this SDK to register sensors to DevIoT, and sync up data and actions between the sensors and DevIoT.

###[DevIoT RaspberryPi Starter_Kit](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_RaspberryPi_Starter_Kit)
RaspberryPi gateway service can be used to work with DevIoT, supply the DevIot capability with read sensor data, control sensor status, define sensor action

This code also can be as a sample code to show how to use the Gateway Service SDK, use it build a completed gateway service which can work with DevIot

###[DevIoT Arduino Starter Kit](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIoT_Arduino_Starter_Kit)
Arduino is common term for a software company, project, and user community, that designs and manufactures computer open-source hardware, open-source software, and microcontroller-based kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control physical devices

Arduino gateway service can be used to work with DevIot, supply the DevIot capability with read sensor data, control sensor status, define sensor action

This code also can be as a sample code to show how to use the Gateway Service SDK, use it build a completed gateway service which can work with DevIoT

###[DevIoT Game Gateway  Starter Kit](https://github.com/tingxin/DevIotCar)
A Starter Kit for building the game gateway service to work with the Cisco DevIoT

The document and the code samples will provide a complete end to end example of how to use this SDK to build a gateway service to work with Cisco DevIoT.

DevIoT is an Internet of things development environment enabling frictionless design and  deployment of complex IoT solutions.more detail

The SDK focus on follow things:

Register sensors to DevIot platform
Help developer build sensors in Unity3d Game quickly
Sync up the sensor data between Game and DevIot
Recevie command from DevIot to trigger the sensor
